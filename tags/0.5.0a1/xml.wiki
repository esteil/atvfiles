This is just some examples of the ATVFiles XML metadata format.  I claim no accuracy of the data in the examples.

== XML Format ==
It's pretty simple, here's the complete sample from the README showing all possible tags:

  <media [type="TV Show"]>
    <title>Title</title>
    <artist>Artist</artist>
    <summary>Summary of Media</summary>
    <description>Description of Media</description>
    <publisher>Publisher</publisher>
    <composer>Composer</composer>
    <copyright>Copyright</copyright>
    <userStarRating>5</userStarRating>
    <starRating>5</starRating>
    <rating>TV-PG</rating>
    <seriesName>Veronica Mars</seriesName>
    <broadcaster>The CW</broadcaster>
    <episodeNumber>101</episodeNumber>
    <season>1</season>
    <episode>1</episode>
    <published>2006-01-01</published>
    <acquired>2006-01-01</acquired>
    <duration>3600</duration>
  
    <genres>
      <genre primary="true">Mystery</genre>
      <genre>Drama</genre>
    </genres>
  
    <cast>
      <name>Kristen Bell</name>
    </cast>
  
    <producers>
      <name>Rob Thomas</name>
    </producers>
  
    <directors>
      <name>Rob Thomas</name>
    </directors>
  </media>

The "type" attribute on the media tag can be one of the following values: "TV Show", "Song", "Music Video", "Podcast", "Movie", and "Audio Book".  The default value is "Movie".

That attribute determines the information shown on the left-hand side of the screen.

The duration tag will bypass the normal QuickTime-based scanning for file duration.  It is specified in seconds.

Most of the other tags should be self explainatory.  The primary attribute on the genre tag sets the "primary" genre, which is the one shown in the metadata.

    <title>Anchorman</title>
    <description>Ron Burgundy (Ferrell) is the top-rated anchorman in San Diego
      in the '70s. When feminism marches into the newsroom in the form of ambitious
      newswoman Veronica Corningstone (Applegate), Ron is willing to play along at
      first-as long as Veronica stays in her place, covering cat fashion shows, cooking,
      and other "female" interests. But when Veronica refuses to settle for being eye
      candy and steps behind the news desk, it's more than a battle between two perfectly
      coiffed anchor-persons... it's war.</description>
